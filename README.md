# OharaMariBot
Test bot for my Node JS/Discord JS advanture.

Yes, as you can tell, everything here is poorly written, and is barely functional.  There's some leftover functions and some functons are even on the wrong place. 1 of the javascript file is not even used. The tagging system only explores a world of exploits and terrible codes.

This is also my first time learning how to git, so who pray best to my future and see what can I do better here.
